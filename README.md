# Simulated-Annealing

Implement Simulated Annealing Algorithm in Python.

The algorithm description can be found in the related lectures.
Your algorithm must have these inputs:
Test function
Input domain of the test function
Dimension size
Number of repetitions of Metropolis algorithm
Neighborhood radius - percentage of the hyperspace
Initial temperature
Final temperature
Temperature reduction

The algorithm must provide at the output:
Best found value of objective function f(x)
The value of x of the best found f(x)
Convergence graph of the development of the f(x)
An example, together with the useful tips, can be found in the support document.

Test your algorithm on the test functions
